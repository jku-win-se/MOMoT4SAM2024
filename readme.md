# Automation Support for System Simulation and Architecture Layout Design in Cyber-Physical Systems Engineering

Simulations have long been part of hardware-centric system domains. As systems become more complex, so do simulation models, their configurations, and eventual analysis. 
Similarly, architectural design is a common practice for complex industrial systems, which comprise many components that can be arranged in different layouts. This paper presents a model-driven approach to automate the simulation configuration and architectural layouting engineering activities by leveraging model-driven optimization techniques.
The approach extends a research solution, MOMoT (Marrying Optimization and Model Transformations), an academic tool that combines search-based algorithms and model transformations. 
MOMoT is extended with a simulation configuration module that leverages the Functional Mock-up Interface standard to execute simulation models and with a layouting module offering a simple architectural description language for architectural models. Our solution is presented in the context of the AIDOaRt research project and the use case by Volvo Construction Equipment (CE) on engineering a battery-driven construction machine. The approach's main goals are enhancing the automation of the engineering process by introducing model-driven techniques in the systems engineering activities while preserving current simulation practices at the organization.
